# Labeling App
This is a web app for the <a href="http://sdsumechatronics.org">Mechatronics</a> team. It is used for labeling objects within images to train our Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), Perseverance.

The Labeling App is linked to a database; all labels are sent there to later be gathered and train the AUV.

## How To Use
1. Select what object you are labeling from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the image where you want to start your rectangle. Click again where you want to end it.
3. Clicking Next Image or Previous Image will save all labels you've created.
4. The Clear Labels button will clear **all** the labels on your current image.
